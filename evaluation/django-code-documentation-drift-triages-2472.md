## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that triages code documentation drift in Django and stops when all vulnerabilities are resolved.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify code documentation drift in Django systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the Django repository. Focus specifically on code documentation drift. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: all vulnerabilities are resolved.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the Django codebase for active code documentation drift.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: all vulnerabilities are resolved.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Code documentation drift meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: all vulnerabilities are resolved.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it ensures security policies are consistently enforced without gaps.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on code documentation drift to minimize run costs.
