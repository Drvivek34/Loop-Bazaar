## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that debugs error log anomalies in Terraform and stops when performance benchmark is met.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify error log anomalies in Terraform systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the Terraform repository. Focus specifically on error log anomalies. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: performance benchmark is met.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the Terraform codebase for active error log anomalies.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: performance benchmark is met.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Error log anomalies meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: performance benchmark is met.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it automates routine maintenance task and flags exceptions for review.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on error log anomalies to minimize run costs.
