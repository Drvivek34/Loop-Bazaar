## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that optimizes Docker images in Redis and stops when all vulnerabilities are resolved.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify Docker images in Redis systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the Redis repository. Focus specifically on Docker images. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: all vulnerabilities are resolved.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the Redis codebase for active Docker images.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: all vulnerabilities are resolved.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Docker images meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: all vulnerabilities are resolved.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it forces systematic optimization instead of relying on developer memory.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on Docker images to minimize run costs.
