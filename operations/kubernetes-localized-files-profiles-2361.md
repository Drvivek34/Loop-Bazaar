## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that profiles localized files in Kubernetes and stops when no regressions are detected.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify localized files in Kubernetes systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the Kubernetes repository. Focus specifically on localized files. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: no regressions are detected.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the Kubernetes codebase for active localized files.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: no regressions are detected.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Localized files meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: no regressions are detected.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it ensures security policies are consistently enforced without gaps.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on localized files to minimize run costs.
