## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that sweeps Docker images in HuggingFace and stops when performance benchmark is met.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify Docker images in HuggingFace systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the HuggingFace repository. Focus specifically on Docker images. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: performance benchmark is met.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the HuggingFace codebase for active Docker images.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: performance benchmark is met.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Docker images meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: performance benchmark is met.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it ensures security policies are consistently enforced without gaps.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on Docker images to minimize run costs.
