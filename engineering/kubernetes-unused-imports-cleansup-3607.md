## 📝 Description
A repeatable agent workflow that cleans up unused imports in Kubernetes and stops when test coverage reaches 100%.

## 🎯 Use Case (When to Use)
> Use this whenever you need to check or modify unused imports in Kubernetes systems and need a strict exit criteria.

## ⚡ System Prompt / Instructions
```
Analyze the Kubernetes repository. Focus specifically on unused imports. Run the local inspection checks, locate any anomalies, drift, or inefficiencies. Modify the relevant code paths, verify the modifications against the local checks, and repeat the cycle until the stopping condition is fully met: test coverage reaches 100%.
```

## 🏁 Implementation Steps
1. Scan the Kubernetes codebase for active unused imports.
2. Identify any deviations from the target standard: test coverage reaches 100%.
3. Implement corrections, optimization scripts, or code repairs.
4. Rerun the verification command to check the updated state.
5. Log output details and repeat until no deviations remain.

## 🛑 Stopping Condition (Verification)
**Verification Check**: Unused imports meets target standards.
- *Detail*: Checked and confirmed that: test coverage reaches 100%.

## 💡 Why it works
This loop works because it reduces regression risk by integrating tests directly into the loop.

## ⚠️ Implementation Note
* Keep the scope focused on unused imports to minimize run costs.
